# What
This project is to reproduce the results of my Ph.D. thesis and the
corresponding journal and conference papers. This could be useful if you analyze animal
movement data of any species to understand their movement patterns in their
surrounding environment. I have written my scripts and functions in a
clean way and encapsulated them in this repository. The quantitative and graphical
results are totally reproducible and every user can generate them on their own
systems. However, it is still a work in progress.

## How to use
I will provide detailed description of how to run the code on your computer soon. You should start from `main.r`.


## How to get and install
Use git to clone or simply download a zip archive using GitHub interface.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/faridcher/cacpl
```
